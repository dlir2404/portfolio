## Overview

A machine learning project focused on mushroom classification using multiple models and comparing their performance. The project includes comprehensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation using cross-validation techniques.

## Data Processing Pipeline

### Data Preparation
- Loading and splitting semi-colon separated dataset
- Handling 21 different features including:
  - Categorical: cap shape, surface, color, gill properties
  - Continuous: stem dimensions, cap diameter
- Target variable: mushroom classification

### Feature Engineering
- **Categorical Features Processing**:
  - One-hot encoding for 17 categorical features
  - Feature label generation
  - Conversion to sparse matrix format

- **Continuous Features Processing**:
  - Standard scaling for numerical features
  - Normalization of stem dimensions and cap diameter
  - Feature concatenation for final dataset

## Model Implementation

### Cross-validation
- Implemented k-fold cross-validation (k=10)
- Consistent evaluation across all models
- Robust performance measurement

### Models Evaluated

1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
   - Tested k values from 1 to 10
   - Best performance at k=15
   - Accuracy: 100%

2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
   - Linear kernel implementation
   - C=1 hyperparameter
   - Accuracy: 88%

3. **Decision Tree**
   - Default parameters
   - Accuracy: 100%

4. **Gaussian Naive Bayes**
   - Probabilistic classifier
   - Accuracy: 60%

5. **Neural Network**
   - MLP Classifier
   - Alpha=1, max_iterations=1000
   - Accuracy: 100%

## Results Analysis

### Performance Comparison
- Top Performing Models:
  - KNN (k=15): 100%
  - Neural Network: 100%
  - Decision Tree: 100%
- Mid-Range Performance:
  - SVM: 88%
- Lower Performance:
  - Gaussian NB: 60%

### Key Findings
